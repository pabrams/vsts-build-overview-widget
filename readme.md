A dashboard widget to show the percentage of builds passing for a given build definition folder, not including subfolders.

When configuring the widget, you must use slashes to separate the folder levels, and the string must start with a slash.

These are pipeline folders. So to configure the widget to show statistics for all builds in the "deploy" subfolder of the "application" pipeline folder, you'd configure the widget field to say "/applicaton/deploy".

If you have any recommendations or issues, please use the Issue tracker on github.
